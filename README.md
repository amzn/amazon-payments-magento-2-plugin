# Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon for Magento 2

This extension provides an official integration of your Magento 2 store with **Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon** services. The extension is a checkout and payment solution that does not share any item level information (product information, prices, basket content, etc) with Amazon. The extension integrates Amazon Pay seamlessly into the Magento 2 shop backend (configuration, order management, billing, etc.).
