# Amazon Pay for Magento 2
This extension provides an official integration of your Magento 2 store with **Amazon Pay** services. The extension is a checkout and payment solution that does not share any item level information (product information, prices, basket content, etc) with Amazon. The extension integrates Amazon Pay seamlessly into the Magento 2 shop backend (configuration, order management, billing, etc.).

## About Amazon Pay
Amazon Pay offers a familiar and convenient buying experience that can help your customers spend more time shopping and less time checking out. Amazon Pay is used by large and small companies. From years of shopping safely with Amazon, customers trust their personal information will remain secure and know many transactions are covered by the Amazon A-to-z Guarantee. Businesses have the reassurance of our advanced fraud protection and payment protection policy.

## What's new in Amazon Pay for Magento 2?
Starting from version 5.0.0, Amazon Pay is hosted on the Magento Marketplace and features our next generation web checkout technology. This places the Amazon shipping and payment widgets outside the Magento checkout template system, improving usability and transaction error handling. Here are some of the improvements over the previous module:

* An Amazon-Hosted checkout experience (replacing inline widgets solution)
* Fewer checkout steps (merging consent and address/payment selection screen)
* Avoids problems on browsers that have active cookie blocking or tracking protection mechanisms
* Supports digital goods as well as physical goods
* Automatic, graceful handling of declined authorization, increasing checkout conversion rate
* Built-in Alexa Delivery Notifications feature support
* Ability to hide Amazon Pay as a checkout option for specific product categories

## Full feature list
* _Amazon Pay_ button in the shopping cart, mini-cart, on product pages and in the 1st step of checkout
* _Amazon Sign-in_ optional button on customer login and registration page
* _Amazon Pay_ in the list of available payment methods during the final step of checkout
* Configuration of _Amazon Pay_ extension from within Magento Admin
