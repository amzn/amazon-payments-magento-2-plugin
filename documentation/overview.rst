Overview
========

This extension provides an official integration of your Magento 2 store with **Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon** services. They help your customers shop quickly, safely and securely. Your customers can pay on your website without re-entering their payment and address details. All Amazon Pay transactions are protected by Amazon's A-to-z Guarantee.

The extension is a pure payment solution. No item level is communicated to Amazon Pay and it allows you to manage your orders directly from Magento 2.
